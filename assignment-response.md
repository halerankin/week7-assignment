# Final Project Plan

## Project name
Weatherman

## Elevator pitch
I plan to convert a web-based weather app I built over a year ago using vanilla JS and Axios to now use React. It will feature an input for city or zip; and it will display current weather and a five-day forecast.

## Wireframes
Will a comp suffice?

## Task List

- [ ] Test first with copy of data locally, then switch to API and re-test.
